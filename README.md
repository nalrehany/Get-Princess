# Get Princess
For some OOP practice, I created the game of Get Princess whereby using the arrow keys, the player must avoid the moving goblins in order to reach the princess. This game largely utilized OOP to create the player, goblin, and princess, figures. I have always been a gamer and never will be a game developer, however, this was excellent OOP practice in my early days of coding and it was quite fun to build a working game.

I opted to use pygame to further my knowledge of python. Repetition is key, creating various classes and instances in a game is a surefire way to drill the concept of OOP into ones head.

This tutorial is for a basic Space Invaders game, but I modified my game as well as various functions and classes to add some of my own work to it.
